## DnH C Mentorship

Goals:

- Learning C
- For intermediate learners, preferably with some exposure to programming
- Self-Driven with support & mentorship from community

---

Why C?:

- Simple (not easy), fast & portable language which is close to the computer
- Great for gaining an understanding of what makes system internals tick
- Popular in several fields of computing & programming:
  - Competitive Programming
  - Operating Systems, Drivers & other low-level software development
  - Embedded & Edge Device Programming

---

Learning Process:

- Async Learning & Virtual Mentoring
- 5-2 Model
- We will start on a the weekend, say, on a Saturday evening with a face to face call for dissemination of study & reference material for the initial topic
- Learners will have a period of 5 days to go over this material and try out exercises
- The next Saturday evening, we will get together for Office Hours to focus on clarifying questions and doubts that the learners have
- During the Office Hours call, materials for the next topic will be shared
- repeat!
- Approx. duration for the entire programme would be 6-8 weeks

---

Expectations: 

- Workload of typically 15-20 hrs/wk, but no more than 25hrs/wk.

- Able to independently go over the study material for the week, attempt to solve questions and problems presented there
