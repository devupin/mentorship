## DnH Python Mentorship

Goals:

- A major goal of this mentorship is to teach people how to learn (programming is just one cool side effect ;))
   
   It is easier to help and uplift people who are willing to work hard and this entire setup is made to encourage such people who are willing to put in hours and learn. As you progress in your career, you will have to learn various things. Often you have to self learn. This program attempts to teach that and help you along the way.

- Build an Indian community of learners and enthusiastic developers.
   
   I am hoping people who have learnt in this session, stick around and help the next cohort, contribute back to the community. It would be nice to have a community of friendly developers helping each other.

Idea:

In typical classrooms, the teacher first explains the material, students ask the questions based on it and it repeats. We will not do that. I feel the ROI for time isn't that great, plus in a mentorship setup, this will be hard to focus and help people individually.

I propose an alternate method (which I learnt from someone else recently) where I will find the materials from the internet which are good and share them with you. In the 'class', we will just discuss the doubts.

The Internet already has plenty of good resources, so why recreate them again? Since I will be providing the materials, you don't have to worry about exhaustion from the plethora of tutorials on the internet.

Method:

All the mentoring will happen online, in Slack and weekly Zoom calls.

Here's the outline:

1. Every Friday evening I will share the materials
2. After 3 days on Tuesday evening, we will have a zoom call, I will briefly explain the concepts and discuss all the doubts.
3. The same day I will share the next set of materials.
4. We will meet again on Friday evening
5. ???
6. Profit

(here Friday is just an example starting point)

We will also have a dedicated slack channel that will be active 24 x 7. It will have other mentors/experienced programmers who will also help. So if you are stuck, you don't have to wait till the next doubts session. Just ask in the channel and someone will help you.

Community:

- There will be a slack channel just for mentoring
- I will help you assign you a buddy so that you pair with someone else who is also learning. This is optional though.
- You could also form a group of 3-4 people and do a group project at the end. I will help you with all the logistics. This is optional too, but I highly recommend it.

If you have more ideas for community activities, I am all ears.

Material:

Our core material is Automate Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd edition. This book is released under CC license and is free to read online.

FAQ:

1. What are the prerequisites? 
No technical knowledge or background is necessary. If you can google, then you are good enough. However, you are expected to put in a minimum of 10 hours weekly.

2. Can I join even if I don't have a computer?
Mobile/Tablet will be difficult, however, I don't want to discourage anyone from learning. 

3. What are the fees? Is there any money involved?
No, this is free. The only fee is to be kind and teach others when you learn.

4. How many hours per week?
Minimum of 10.

5. What if I miss a doubt session? 
The mentorship will be always active to ask questions. We will try to set up one more session if there are lots of people who need it and if we have more mentors available. 

6. I am an experienced programmer, how can I help?
 - Join the slack channel and help people!
 - Help me conduct office hours. If you are interested in doing this, please DM me once you join the slack. 
 - Find really good material, which complements the book
